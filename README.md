# COTS
- This repository contains atmega32 and stm32f103c8t6 microcontrollers drivers based on layered architecture 
- Hardware peripherals and some external hardware interfaces that will be useful to learn embedded system c applications
- OTA project contains a bootloader design to receive hex files from a web server to update stm32f103c8t6 firmware wirelessly. The design handels data authentication, security and   admin control for the subscribed nodes to the server.
